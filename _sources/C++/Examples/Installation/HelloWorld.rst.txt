Example source code (`HelloWorld.cxx <https://gitlab.orfeo-toolbox.org/orfeotoolbox/otb/raw/develop/Examples/Installation/HelloWorld.cxx?inline=false>`__):

.. code-block:: cpp

    //  The following code is an implementation of a small OTB
    //  program. It tests including header files and linking with OTB
    //  libraries.
    
    #include "otbImage.h"
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main()
    {
      typedef otb::Image<unsigned short, 2> ImageType;
    
      ImageType::Pointer image = ImageType::New();
    
      std::cout << "OTB Hello World !" << std::endl;
    
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    
    //  This code instantiates an image whose pixels are represented with
    //  type \code{unsigned short}. The image is then constructed and assigned to a
    //  \doxygen{itk}{SmartPointer}. Although later in the text we will discuss
    //  \code{SmartPointer}'s in detail, for now think of it as a handle on an
    //  instance of an object (see section \ref{sec:SmartPointers} for more
    //  information).  The \doxygen{itk}{Image} class will be described in
    //  Section~\ref{sec:ImageSection}.
