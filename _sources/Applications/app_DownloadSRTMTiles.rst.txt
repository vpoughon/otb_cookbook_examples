Download or list SRTM tiles

Description
-----------

This application allows selecting the appropriate SRTM tiles that covers a list of images. It builds a list of the required tiles. Two modes are available: the first one download those tiles from the USGS SRTM3 website (http://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/), the second one list those tiles in a local directory. In both cases, you need to indicate the directory in which directory  tiles will be download or the location of local SRTM files.
